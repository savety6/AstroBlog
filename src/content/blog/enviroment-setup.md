This guide will walk you through setting up your MongoDB development environment on Windows.

## Installation Options

MongoDB can be installed on Windows through several methods:

- Official MongoDB installer (recommended for beginners)
- Package managers:
  - Chocolatey
  - Scoop
- Containerization:
  - Docker
- Virtual Machine

We'll focus on the official installer method as it's the most straightforward approach.

## Installing MongoDB Community Edition

MongoDB provides two essential tools for database interaction:
1. MongoDB Compass - A powerful GUI for visual database management
2. MongoDB Shell - A command-line interface for database operations

### Step 1: Download and Install MongoDB

1. Visit the [MongoDB Download Center](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
2. Download the latest MongoDB Community Edition

### Step 3: MongoDB Shell Setup

To enable command-line database operations:

1. Visit the [MongoDB Shell Download Page](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/shell)
2. Download the latest version
3. Choose your preferred installation method:
   - MSI installer: Automatically handles PATH configuration
   - ZIP archive: Requires manual PATH configuration
   
If using the ZIP archive, remember to add the MongoDB Shell directory to your system's PATH environment variable.
